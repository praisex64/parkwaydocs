title: "Virtual Account Introduction"
---

The RAILs Virtual Account System **(R-VAS)** API gives you access to create, manage and make payments to publicly accessible wallet accounts maintained by the RAILs or the integrating partner.

The virtual account enables an integrating partner to receive customer payments using the account number as an identifier for a customer, a specific transaction, or an invoice.

R-VAS Operates in 2 modes
#### 1. RAILs Maintained 
In this mode, the merchant makes an API call to RVAS to create a virtual account. Virtual accounts created this way have the following attributes.  

  - **expires**: An expiry timestamp may be specified to invalidate the virtual account. This is useful when the IM requires payments are made against it within a specific period.
  - **tied to an amount**: A virtual account can be tied to a specific amount. This attribute is useful when the partner requires that a specific amount be paid against the virtual account
  - **used multiple times**: a virtual can be configured to allow single or multiple payments against it.

#### 2. Partner Maintained
In this mode, the R-VAS issues a block of account numbers typically identified with a 2- 4 digit prefix to the partner. When payments or inquiries are made against any account number that pattern matches a maintained block, R-VAS makes a callback request to the partner's system to validate (in real-time) and to notify of payments. R-VAS does not take care of the actual VA numbers and is only aware of a specific number pattern. other attributes of VAs 
managed this way are  

- **can expire** : since the integrating partner maintains the actual virtual account numbers and has somehow communicated them to the users. They can be set to expire on the partners' system
- **cannot be tied to an amount**: All amounts are accepted by the integrating partner except in cases where R-VAS has set a predefined minimum
- **can be used multiple times:**   Multiple payments will be made against it.
