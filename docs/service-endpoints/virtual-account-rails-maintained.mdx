title: "Modalities for Rails Maintained Virtual Accounts"
---

For partners integrating with rails maintained virtual accounts and have been issued an account block or a prefix
can receive payments against those accounts virtual accounts.

The integrating partner is required to provide 2 endpoints, one to validate the account number and return an account name.

This integration mode gives merchants the flexibility of using their customer references/ids as virtual accounts as long as they follow the standard 10 digits length with the issued  
2 - 4 digit prefix


When payments are recieved through compatible channels, a notification is sent via `HTTP POST` to the partners system via the provided callback resource

The notification payload would have this format

```json Notification Payload
{
  "accountNumber": "0310001256",
  "amount": 10000.0,
  "transactionType": "90",
  "transactionTypeDescription": "INBOUND BANK TRANSFER",
  "terminalId": null,
  "merchantId": null,
  "cardAcceptor": null,
  "channel": "3",
  "narration": "INBOUND NIP",
  "maskedPan": "",
  "surcharge": 0,
  "transmissionDate": 1688411035000,
  "reference": "00001431769732892718897368295643",
  "transactionState": "FINAL",
  "senderAccount": "0007340005",
  "senderAccountName": "MARA XYZ MAIN ACCOUNT",
  "mac": "cad09c2f5f1ac2574d0f189bd66569281503901530129d8dc2326b028e80f2993deef76e71187542ae3106e2e4813ba3267286f5dc90f5c9564f92af59bfb257",
  "localId": 94,
  "senderBank": "Access Bank"
}
```

For response a on the callback a simple `HTTP 200` status code will suffice, any other status would be interpreted as a failed notification, unless in special cases the body content of the response to a notification sent this way is never read.
R-VAS would continue to send the notification until it receives a `HTTP 200` status from the partner.

The MAC computed is a keyed MAC, a shared key would be managed between R-VAS and the partner, the MAC should be verified by the partner before any further action is taken

| `channel` | `string`        | The channel through which the validation call is being made. This will typically be one of these options - `web`, `pos`, `mobile`, `bank`                                                                |
| `reference`     | `string`        | This is a payment reference number used to track a transaction. In cases where the merchant generates e-receipt, it is advised that the parameter be included in the e-receipt.                          |
| `amount`     | `decimal(12,2)` | This specifies the amount paid by the customer/agent. It always carries a 2 decimal place digit indicating the minor denomination of the currency paid with                                              |
| `transmissionDate`    | `integer`        | Timestamp of the transaction                                                                                                                 |
| `merchantId` | `string`        | merchant ID issued to the IM since multiple merchant IDs can be issued to a single IM, this is used to track which ID the particular transaction was made against                                        |
| `mac`     | `string`        | The keyed HMAC SHA512 sum of the parameters in Hex when the parameters are available in the message they must always be MAC'd in this order `mac = hmac_sha512(macKey, reference  +  amt  + accountNumber)` |
