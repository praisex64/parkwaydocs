title: "Modalities for Partner Maintained Virtual Accounts"
---

Alternatively, partners that wish to maintain virtual accounts and have been issued an account block or a prefix
can receive payments against those accounts virtual accounts.

The integrating partner is required to provide 2 endpoints, one to validate the account number and return an account name.

This integration mode gives merchants the flexibility of using their customer references/ids as virtual accounts as long as they follow the standard 10 digits length with the issued  
2 - 4 digit prefix

To validate accounts R-VAS sends a message to a callback URL provided by the partner, and its is expected to return the customers name if successful or an error code if not.

A **Validation** request payload would look like this

```json Request
{
  "custid": "0607340006",
  "channel": "mobile",
  "mac": "ab00ff430598409584758675930945823045830495849"
}
```

An expected response would be

```json Response
{
  "responseCode": "0000",
  "responseDesc": "ISSEY MIYAKE"
}
```

When payments are recieved through compatible channels, a notification is sent via `HTTP POST` to the partners system via the provided callback resource

The notification payload would have this format

```json Notification Payload
{

"date": "20200709044803",
"tranid": "14515945",
"ref": "081241",
"extra": "{\"sessionId\":\"000014200709044330263217788859\",\"amount\":2.5E+2,\"sender\":\"0073XXXX06\",\"senderName\":\"DELE MAJID UDO\",\"senderReference\":\"NXG3475034567\",\"channel\":\"3\",\"beneficiary\":\"0602000001\",\"narration\":\"TEST VIRTUAL ACCOUNT\"}",
"custid": "0602000001",
"channel": "mobile",
"amt": "250.00",
"mac": "a9360820e53918cc919e53612bac404629281901",
"merchId": "001093",
"mac_256": "d40baaa24f9bd092be91e9fad91b72366a26fd919ee727d362ad095b5c4f1d29"

}
```

For response a on the callback a simple `HTTP 200` status code will suffice, any other status would be interpreted as a failed notification, unless in special cases the body content of the response to a notification sent this way is never read.
R-VAS would continue to send the notification until it receives a `HTTP 200` status from the partner.

The MAC computed is a keyed MAC, a shared key would be managed between R-VAS and the partner, the MAC should be verified by the partner before any further action is taken

| `channel` | `string`        | The channel through which the validation call is being made. This will typically be one of these options - `web`, `pos`, `mobile`, `bank`                                                                |
| `ref`     | `string`        | This is a payment reference number used to track a transaction. In cases where the merchant generates e-receipt, it is advised that the parameter be included in the e-receipt.                          |
| `extra`   | `json-string`   | A json string dump of bank transfer specific information which includes information of the sender and the senders financial institution                                                                  |
| `amt`     | `decimal(12,2)` | This specifies the amount paid by the customer/agent. It always carries a 2 decimal place digit indicating the minor denomination of the currency paid with                                              |

| `mac`     | `string`        | The keyed HMAC SHA1 sum of the parameters in Hex when the parameters are available in the message they must always be MAC'd in this order `mac = hmac_sha1(custid  +  ref  +  amt  +  date  +  channel)` |
