description: "This method used to query transactions done against a virtual account."

This endpoint would return a list of transactions made against a particular virtual account
this only works for RAILs maintained virtual account that have a `ttl` shorter than 24hrs
it is useful for timebound payments where the parner wants to poll rather than wait for a callback


 <ParamField path="accountNumber" type="string"  required >
  The virtual account number to query for
